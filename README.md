# Stack Application Using C++

## Project Overview:
This project implements a stack data structure in C++ to manage student records. It supports push, pop, and display operations. Each record contains student ID, name, and marks. The application uses a structure to hold data and prevents overflow/underflow.

## Working Principle:
- Students are stored in a stack (LIFO)
- Push operation adds a student record
- Pop removes the top student
- Display shows all stored students

## Components Used:
- C++ Language
- Structures for student records
- Stack implementation (array-based)
- Command-line interface (for input/output)

## Technologies Used:
- C++ Programming
- GCC Compiler / Code::Blocks / VS Code

## Features:
- Add (push) student record
- Remove (pop) student record
- View all records
- Handles stack overflow and underflow

## Future Scope:
- Dynamic memory (linked list-based stack)
- File storage for records
- GUI-based interface
